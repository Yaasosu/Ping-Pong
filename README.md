This is PingPong game which i created between 1 PM and 5 PM when i was bored.

Material which used:
AI - 40+- procent (Explained some features, and helped with problem)
Guide which i used (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLJlTaFvHo4) probably 60 +- procent (Yeah, i can't create hyperlink)

Overall it was my first project on the C + first project on Raylib, and i learned a lot of cool things.
